## Findings
- [WARN] The `publish-docs.yml` workflow has significant code duplication. The Python code for interacting with the Wiki.js API is nearly identical in the `publish` and `publish-ai-review-log` jobs. This violates the DRY principle and makes the workflow harder to maintain, as any change to the API logic must be duplicated. It would be better to refactor this into a reusable script or a GitHub Action.
- [WARN] The `publish-generated-docs` job in `publish-docs.yml` has flawed "upsert" logic. It attempts to create a new page, but if the page already exists, it simply skips it instead of updating it. This means generated documentation will become stale and can never be updated automatically by the workflow. This is inconsistent with the other jobs in the same file which correctly handle updates.
- [INFO] The workflow for persisting AI review logs remains clunky. The `ai-review.sh` script creates a log file locally during the pre-push hook, but this file is not automatically included in the push. The developer must remember to manually `git add` and `commit` this file in a subsequent commit. This creates an awkward, error-prone workflow where review history may be easily lost.
- [INFO] The `publish-docs.yml` workflow embeds large, multi-line Python scripts directly in the YAML. This is difficult to read, maintain, and lint. These scripts should be extracted into their own `.py` files and called from the workflow to improve modularity and allow for standard code quality tools to be used.
