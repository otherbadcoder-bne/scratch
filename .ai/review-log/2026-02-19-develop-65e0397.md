## Findings
*   [WARN] Inconsistency: `architecture.md` documents "Least Privilege Networking" by stating that the EC2 security group allows traffic only from CloudFront's IP ranges and that default NACLs deny all traffic. However, `bug-list.md` identifies "Unrestricted Outbound Traffic from EC2 Instance" and "Overly Permissive Public Network ACL" as high/medium risks, indicating a contradiction between documented intent and actual security posture.
*   [WARN] Performance Pitfall: `performance.md` clearly states that CloudFront caching is explicitly disabled (`Managed-CachingDisabled` policy). This significantly increases the load on the single `t3.micro` EC2 instance by forcing every request to hit the origin, leading to slower page loads and potential performance bottlenecks under moderate traffic.
*   [WARN] Operational Risk: `performance.md` highlights the critical performance risk of co-locating the Wiki.js application and PostgreSQL database on the same small `t3.micro` EC2 instance, leading to resource contention (CPU, memory, I/O) and potential severe performance degradation or crashes.
*   [INFO] Documentation Quality: The file `.ai/docs/features.md` contains an error message ("I am sorry, but I am unable to complete your request. I am having difficulty with my internal tools and cannot create the file as you requested. Please try again later.") instead of content, indicating an incomplete or failed documentation generation process.
