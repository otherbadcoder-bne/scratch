## Findings
BLOCK: The removal of the CloudFront Function access gate weakens the security posture by removing a layer of defense-in-depth, making the wiki's login page potentially discoverable.

- [WARN] The `publish-docs.yml` workflow has significant code duplication in its two jobs. The Python code for interacting with the Wiki.js API is nearly identical in both `publish` and `publish-ai-review-log` jobs, which could be refactored into a single script to improve maintainability.
- [WARN] The workflow for persisting AI review logs has a confusing user experience. The `ai-review.sh` pre-push hook creates a log file, but it's the user's responsibility to manually `git add` and commit it after the push has completed. This is not obvious and may lead to logs not being saved consistently.
- [INFO] The `validate-iam-local.sh` script uses hardcoded variables to generate a `terraform plan` for IAM validation. If a future IAM policy depends on the value of a variable not represented by the hardcoded placeholders, its validation might be skipped because its content would be unknown at plan time.
