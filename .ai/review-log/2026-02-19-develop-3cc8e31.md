## Findings
BLOCK: The push includes documentation of a critical, unaddressed bug where the CloudFront origin will break daily, but does not include a fix.
* [BLOCK] The file `.ai/docs/bug-list.md` documents that the CloudFront origin uses the EC2 instance's dynamic public DNS. Combined with the daily restart schedule, this will cause the site to become unavailable after every restart. The diff does not include a fix for this, such as associating an Elastic IP. Pushing code with a known critical, operational bug is unsafe.
* [WARN] The new documentation (`.ai/docs/bug-list.md`, `.ai/docs/performance.md`) details multiple unaddressed high-severity security risks, including unencrypted traffic between CloudFront and the origin, and unrestricted egress from the EC2 instance. The code should be fixed, not just documented as insecure.
* [WARN] The file `.ai/docs/features.md` consists of a single line that appears to be an error message from an AI tool. This file should be removed or corrected before being committed, as it adds no value and creates confusion.
* [INFO] The analysis in `.ai/docs/bug-list.md` correctly identifies that there are two scripts named `validate-iam-policies.sh`, which is confusing. These should be renamed to clarify their purpose and scope (e.g., a root-level dispatcher and a project-specific validator).
